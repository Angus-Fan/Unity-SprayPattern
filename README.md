# Unity Spray pattern
This was a project that I made in order to understand how FPS recoil and spread patterns are implemented. If you would like a short video on my thought processes and implementation then you can check out this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNSQWPhalGQ).

This project does not include the assets that were used in the final video, as I do not have the rights to distribute such materials. However in the project files you will locate a few scripts: namely a firearm script, FPS playermovement script, and a camera script. Please do be aware that the code used to reset the player's camera is not very well implemented and resets back to center of the 0,0 plane of the screen. Meaning that if you decide to look up and then fire, the camera will quickly jerk back to center and back up.
